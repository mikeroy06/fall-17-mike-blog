<h1>Welcome to the world of Mike Roy. Think you can handle it?</h1>

<p>I decided to take this class a few weeks ago. I really wanted to learn more about the business of web devlopment and web designing. I used to work in radio and decided that I wanted a carer change. I just couldn't find the right stability or job security. I have started coding on my own and have been doing it for about 2 years. I'm ready to jump onto the next level. </p>

	<p>I also enjoy playing the guitar and music. I like to cook and I am a scorekeeper for the Gwinnett Braves.</p>

	<p>I am getting married in January. I'm excited!!!</p>
