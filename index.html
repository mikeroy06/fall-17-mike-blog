	<p>Have you ever heard of the band <span class="pink">Pink Floyd?</span> You haven't? Well, take a seat.</p>

	<br>

	<p>Pink Floyd is one of the most famous bands of all time and my all-time favorite. They originated in the 1960's. Lead singer <span id="bold">Syd Barrett</span> left the band shortly after their first album <span class="italic">Piper at the Gates of Dawn </span>and was replaced by <span class="bold">David Gilmour.</span> As they progressed, bassist <span id="bold">Roger Waters</span> began to take a more leading role. His final album with the band was entitled <span class="italic">The Final Cut.</span> Afterwards, recently ousted keyboardist <span id="bold">Rick Wright</span> reentered the band as they continued onward with their album <span class="italic">Momentary Lapse of Reason.</span></p><br>

<p>They recorded one more studio album entitled <span class="italic">The Division Bell.</span> All 4 members came back together for a 30 minute set for Live Aid in London in 2005.</p> <br>

<p>Sadly, original vocalist <span class="bold">Syd Barrett </span>passed away in 2006. Two years later keyboardist <span class="bold">Rick Wright </span>passed away as well. </p><br>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this musical journey through the illustrious career of Pink Floyd. I know you did. Otherwise, you fine people wouldn't be reading my blog.</p><br>

<p>Until next time........</p>
